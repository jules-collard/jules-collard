## Hi there, I'm Jules ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Statistics student at Imperial College London, having graduated from McGill University with a BSc in Honours Probability & Statistics. Based in London and Montreal, I'm interested in developing and applying statistical methods for sports analytics.

On this page you can find some of my projects, including:
- [Analysis of Crossover Trials](https://github.com/jules-collard/Analysis-of-Crossover-Trials) Source code, report & presentation for my majors research project.
- [Exploring Max EV](https://github.com/jules-collard/Exploring-MaxEV) Source code for research project on modelling exit velocities from baseball players.
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/jules-collard/linear-regression-ols) Source code & documentation for a python package implementing linear regression from scratch.
- [BioMechZoo](https://github.com/jules-collard/biomechzoo) A python package developed by the McGill MOTION Lab, where I contributed to preparing the code for publication to PyPi.
